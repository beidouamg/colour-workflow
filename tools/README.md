- 'colour.py' contains the python functions that allows one to calculate the reflectivity and CIE colour coordinates giving as input the complex dielectric function.
- 'cmf_1nm.dat' contains the colour matching functions (as a function of the wavelength of light) which are needed to calculate the tristimulus values X, Y, Z.
- 'D65_illuminant_1nm.dat' contains the spectral power distribution of the D65 illuminant (corresponding to average daylight) within the visible range.
